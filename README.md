# EndGem

A course content management app, where users can keep their PDF files under different courses. 

Maintaining course content has always been a pain when you have a lot of courses and each of them having multiple documents such as books, tutorials, assignments and not to forget the life-saving friendâ€™s notes

The course content is grouped based on the course it belongs to. The app contains a fully functioning leaderboard for each course, which will sort the course files on the number of its downloads. This leaderboard (Top Gems) will help one to choose the diamond amongst the gems.

To run the app, simply head over to https://polar-island-28985.herokuapp.com 

OR

Run

npm i

In the terminal to install all dependencies. Then Type

localhost:4444

in your browser to run the app locally.

Hope you like it! :)
